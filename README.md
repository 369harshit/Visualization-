Matplotlib | Pandas Built-in Data Visualization | Visualizing Time series Data

Step-1: Matplolib-Matplotlib is a popular Python library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in a 2D format. It provides a wide range of high-quality charts and plots, making it a versatile tool for data visualization in various fields such as scientific computing, data analysis, and machine learning.

Step-2: Pandas Built-in Data Visualization-
                      [1]Pandas is an open-source data manipulation and analysis library for Python. It provides easy-to-use data structures (primarily DataFrame and Series objects) and functions needed to manipulate and analyze structured data seamlessly. Pandas is a fundamental tool in the Python data science ecosystem and is widely used for tasks such as data cleaning, exploration, transformation, and analysis.
                      [2]Pandas built-in data visualization refers to the plotting functionality provided by the Pandas library for creating simple visualizations directly from DataFrame and Series objects. It is built on top of the Matplotlib library but offers a higher-level, more convenient interface for common plotting tasks.

Step-3: Visualizing Time series Data -Visualizing time series data is essential for understanding patterns, trends, and seasonal variations over time. Time series data represents observations or measurements taken at different points in time
